## Eviction Filings and Permits Linked to Parcel Records

### You can explore a map of parcels with linked evictions [as its own web page here](https://cgilchriest-dcccd.github.io/eviction-parcel-matching/)

Sample demonstration of matching East Dallas eviction records to parcels. 

In sample area:  
-- 81% (3,757 out of 4,637) of eviction filings could be linked with a high degree of confidence to a parcel/DCAD account.  
-- 67% of multifamily units had at least one eviction.  
-- 85% of all evictions took place in multifamily buildings.  

Note that its possible to get an address match but not be able to tell precisely which condo or unit of a building, i.e. one parcel can have multiple associated accounts. So I just grouped by the parcel itself, and counted unique evictions by property.
